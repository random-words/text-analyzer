const text = `In the heart of a bustling city stood an old bookstore named "Whispers of the Past." It was nestled between towering skyscrapers, a relic of a bygone era, its windows dusty and its sign faded. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of aged paper and adventure. Shelves upon shelves of books reached toward the high ceiling, filled with stories waiting to be discovered.

The owner, Mr. Elliott, was a man in his late sixties, with spectacles perpetually perched on the tip of his nose. He moved between the aisles with a slow, deliberate pace, dusting off forgotten tomes and rearranging misplaced volumes. The bookstore was his life's work, and every book had a story he could recountâ€”not just the stories within the pages, but stories of those who had read them.

One rainy afternoon, as the clouds wept over the city, the bell above the door jingled softly. A young woman stepped in, shaking off her umbrella. Her name was Eliza, a university student studying literature. The old bookstore was her escape from the world, a place where she could dive into the lives of others and forget her own troubles.`;
